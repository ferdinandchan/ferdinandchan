Hi there, welcome to my blog

My name is Ferd and I am a Christian, a husband and a father. If you want to know what I'm focusing on right now, please check out my ["now"](/now) page.

I believe "write to think" is a good way to clarify my thoughts and force me to slow down, ponder and reflect. This blog is a collection of writings that clarify my mind and reflect on the books I read. I wrote all of them without LLM assistance, except for spelling and grammar checks via Grammarly. If you are interested in how I use AI, please check out my ["AI Manifesto"](/ai) page.

I hope you find some of them interesting to read, or even better, learn something from them.
